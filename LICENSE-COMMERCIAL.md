## FAQ

### Q: Can I evaluate Cortex before purchasing a license?

**A:** Yes. You can use Cortex under the AGPL-3.0 license for evaluation,
development, and testing. A commercial license is only required when you
deploy in a commercial context that doesn't comply with AGPL-3.0.

### Q: Do I need a license for internal business use?

**A:** If you use Cortex purely internally (not offered as a service to
third parties, not distributed), the AGPL-3.0 typically permits this.
However, if you modify Cortex and offer it as a network service, you would
need to disclose your modifications or obtain a commercial license.

### Q: What about contributions?

**A:** Contributions to the Cortex project are welcome under the AGPL-3.0
and will be incorporated into both the open source and commercially
licensed versions.
